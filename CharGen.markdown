The Spaghetti Plaza Player's Guide

Everything in this post is subject to change.

How it's Played

Every 24 hrs I will make a post with a description of the current situation and players will have until I make the next post to act.

If everyone acts and I'm prepared I may make a post sooner.

The players may PASS if they do not want to act and want to hurry to the next turn. Conversely players may request a HOLD if for some reason they will be prohibited from making a post and need more time. Players may override a HOLD by adding a :NoBozo: reaction to the post.



I'll be trying to stick to a format for each of my posts:

DM actions will be in normal print...

Descriptions in italics...

-Character Name-
"Dialogue in quotes..."

```and meta, mechanics and foot notes in code blocks.```




All players will be required to use Hina to roll in the forum. Just type !{roll}K{keep}, replacing the brackets with the appropriate numbers. If Hina isn't logged in just @ me and I'll get her runnig ASAP.

This forum will only be used when the party is together in one group. It's very possible that it will only be used at the beginning and end of quests. If you are solo your actions should be PM'd to me and if you split off in groups I may make  a forum that only that sub group can access.

Not only are you completely free to, but I encourage the players to discuss their actions privately with each other, the DM isn't required. If you are negotiating or just RPing with another character I won't be needed unless you think I need to be there for some reason or to resolve a die roll between players. Still use this forum though for discussions that you want the entire party to be aware of and make sure that you have some means of communicating with EVERY player in game.

Try to keep this forum clean and on topic, if you need to shitpost do that in the Bun House. If you want to do some test rolls for some reason PM Hina as to not fill up the forum.

L5R Character Creation Part 1: Pro Tips Before You Start!

Here is a list of things to help you, the player, create a successful L5R character.

1. ~Don't Make a Special Snowflake~

Not only is it just common courtesy but this system and its fictional society favors conformists. You will find this to be espicially true when you start chosing Advantages/Disadvantages. If you choose a clan and family and your immediate reaction is to be the odd guy with a different belief set, you are going to have a miserable character that no one wants to interact with. There are plenty of clans with differing beliefs, you shouldn't have too much problem finding one that fits your idea.

2. ~Page 100~

Page 100 has a 20 questions game. If you were asked any, you should be able to answer most of them on the spot. It will set you up with a rather fleshed out character.

3. ~Insightful vs. Specialists~

In L5R the highest level character is not necessarily the best. There is a lot of minutiae involved so to keep it short: gaining many diffrent skills and attributes will level you up fast but you will be a Jack-of-All-Trades master of none. Increasing your level gives you new skills from your school. It will be up to you to decide if you want to favor high stats or a high level.

4. ~Book of Water~

Pages 211 to 281 contains The Book of Water, a set of advanced rules. It contains a set of alternate starts (minor clans, Ronin etc) and mid game rules (katas, graduate schools etc). You can use all of these rules, just keep in mind that the alternate starts are generally more difficult and specialized. Only take them if you are confident.

****************

L5R Character Creation Part 2: Character Generation

I will highly suggest using the character sheet provided in the book at least as a reference, it makes under standing the system much easier. 

1. ~Inner and Outer Ring~

Your characteristics are 8 attributes and 5 elements. Starting out all characteristics are 2, every element is always the lowest of the two attached attributes (i.e. Agl of 4 and Int of 3 gives a Fire of 3). You will notice that Void has not atributes. Set it to 2.

2. ~Clan and Family~

Next chose the clan that you want to be in and one of the four families they provide (minor clans only have 1 family). Your Family will give a +1 to one of your attributes.

3. ~Choose School~

This acts as your characters class. There are 3 major classes: Bushi (Warrior), Courtier (Diplomat), Shugenja (Priest/Wizard). Each Clan provides one of each and a fourth school, usually for their favored class. There are two others, Monk and Ninja but these are special cases.

Your school gives several things:
- +1 to an attribute (update your element if necessary)
- a list of skills
- Honour (fill in the bubbles and make ticks or some other markings if you have decimals)
- Gear
- A Rank 1 technique, summarize it

If you are a Shugenja then you only ever get 1 technique and you will also get
- An elemental Afftinity/Deficiency
-A list of spells

4. ~Advantages/Disadvantages~

You are allowed to spend 10 exp on Advantages and you may gain up to 10 exp when taking Disadvantages. Remember that this game favors conformity and that many of these will either be cheaper or more expensive based on you clan. (i.e. large is cheaper for Crabs because many of them are big and Lions and Mantis gain more from being obtuse).

You do not need to hit your limit for Advantages or Disadvantages but most players will. If you finish with either a profit or deficit of exp, mark it down for the next section.

****************

L5R Character Creation Part 3: Spending EXP and Finalizations!

Starting characters begin with 40 exp +-anything leftover from purchasing Advantages/Disadvantages. If you want a extra challenge you may start at Rank 0 making you a samurai in training. If you like the idea of having no skills, ask me about it.

Here is the cost list for exp (these may be diffrent based on your Adv/Disadv):

- Increase any attribute: Next Rank *4
- Increase Void: Next Rank * 6
- Increase Skill: Next Rank
-New Skill: 1 Point
-An emphasis in a skill costs 2 points (you are allowed an additional emphasis at skill ranks 1,3,5,7 and 9)
-Permenantly Memorize Spell: Cost = Spell Level

You are not allowed to start with anything above rank 4

~Filling Out the Sheet~

Everyone Starts with 1 in glory and Status (unless changes by Adv/Disadv)

The roll category for skill is (Rank+Trait) K (Trait)

Damage counts up in this system so the wounds box is left blank. In Total, Healthy box, write your Earth Ring * 5. For each box in the column, add Earth * 2 progressively till you reach OUT. If you have modifiers, write them in the penalties box and write the sum in the current boxes.

Attacks are done with a skill check, damage delt is based on the weapon adding Str to total number of dice rolled.

Initiative is (Insight+Ref) K (Ref)

Armour TN is Ref * 5+5

~Calculating Insight~

Insight is similar to you character's level, it is calculated: Rings * 10 + Skill Ranks

FINALLY

PM me these things:

-Name & brief description
-Clan & School
-Advantages & Disadvantages
-Immediate family (parents, spouse, children and/or siblings) and any points of interest. (I will fill in any blanks such as name or traits, you must atleast have parents. Even if they are both deceased.)
-Anything else you think I should know
