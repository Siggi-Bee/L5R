When meeting new characters it might be rude to ask them who they are, especially if they are famous and you didn't recognize them. 

You can use Lore:Heraldry (against their Glory) to recognize them and Lore:Bushido to learn their Honour. You can treat people more appropriately that way.

You don't know anyone unless you've been told or have made a successful check. The Empress herself only has a glory of 4 so you might not recognize her if you met her.

You can make these rolls against PCs.
